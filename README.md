70+ JavaScript Challenges - Data Structures and Algorithms, by packt publishing

Unlock the power of data structures and algorithms (DSA) with our comprehensive video course. From basics to advanced topics, embark on a hands-on journey through real-world coding challenges and optimizations.

This course seamlessly interweaves foundational knowledge with hands-on coding challenges to ensure a thorough grasp of the subject. Start with an introduction to DSA's significance, and then immerse yourself in hands-on exercises like "Hello World" to ease into the coding mindset. Delve deeper as you explore arrays, manipulating strings, solving common challenges. Further on, refine your coding finesse as you navigate through hash tables, maps, and sets, crafting elegant solutions to intricate problems like anagram grouping.

But this course doesn't stop at surface-level coding practices. Dive into the depths of intricate data structures like stacks, queues, and linked lists. Experience the beauty of tree structures, binary search trees, and graphs, understanding their traversal and practical applications. Writing code is just half the battle. Understanding the efficiency and optimization of your code is paramount. Grasp the concepts of time and space complexity, and familiarize yourself with iconic sorting algorithms, from bubble sort to quick sort.

By the end of this course, you will have journeyed from the basic constructs of data structures to the intricate maze of algorithms, all the while understanding their real-world applicability and performance nuances.
